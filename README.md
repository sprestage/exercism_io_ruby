My exercism.io solutions
=======

These are my solutions in Ruby to the problems presented at http://exercism.io.

Using Exercism CLI
=======
(from the cli.exercism.io website, for my use)


#####Downloading Exercises

You download exercises with the fetch command.

<code>
  $ exercism fetch
</code>
The first time you run the command, it will download the first exercise in each language. After that, it will download any exercises that you are currently working on, plus the next available exercise that you have not yet submitted any code to.

#####Submitting Exercises

To submit an exercise, use the submit command.

<code>
  $ exercism submit path/to/file.ext
</code>
You only need to submit the code you wrote to solve the exercise, not the test suite that you were given. At the moment each exercise must be solved in a single file.
